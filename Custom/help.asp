          to find property information using this application.</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#333333">This 
          website uses several different search methods for locating information 
          for you. You can find a property of interest by looking up an address, 
          an assessor parcel number, or by cross streets. These searches are visible 
          on the right side of the web page when it first opens. Using any of 
          these searches will immediately return information about the subject 
          property as well as zooming to a map view of the property. If the search 
          criteria is not specific enough the applications will replace the search 
          panel area of the web page with a list of candidate properties that 
          most closely meet your search criteria. You can scroll through the list 
          of candidates to find the property you are interested in. Each candidate 
          property has a hyper-link. Selecting the link will display the detailed 
          property information, as well as zoom the map display to that location.<br>
          In most cases, a less specific search is better. This allows the website 
          to work for you, to return properties that meet your search criteria 
          but may have a slightly different spelling or are stored in the database 
          a little different. Each search method has an associated search tips 
          link next to the &quot;Search&quot; button. Use these search tips to 
          improve your odds of finding the correct property. These tips are also 
          covered below in this help page.</font></b></font><br>

        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000099">What 
          else can I do with this website?</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#333333">The 
          website also provides easy to use tools for saving and printing the 
          information found. Users can also print the map page, either by itself 
          or in a preformatted layout including legends, map scale, title, and 
          locator map. Using the simple map navigation tools at the bottom of 
          the page you can also interactively zoom in/out from a specific map 
          view as well as drag the map to center on a specific location. Once 
          a property has been visually located, use the map &quot;Identify&quot; 
          tool to click on any property (map location) to see details about the 
          selected property. You can also use the &quot;Layers&quot; selection 
          on the bottom toolbar to create a custom map view by turning on/off 
          specific map layers they are interested in. Additionally users can use 
          the buffering tool to find information on surrounding properties and 
          create mailing labels for those properties.</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1" color="#000099">Tools</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">There 
          are 3 sets of tools to choose from when working with this website. As 
          with many computer applications there is a menu system at the top of 
          the page for users who prefer that type of interface. There is also 
          a toolbar at the bottom of the page that contains most of the functions 
          available from the menu interface. There is also a floating toolbar 
          that also contains most of the most commonly used tools. In most cases 
          a user will easily navigate this site using the toolbar on the bottom 
          of the page, and the search and results information presented in the 
          information panel on the right side of the page. Hovering your mouse 
          over a tool icon will pop-up text that identifies the tools use.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          <u><font color="#990000">There is also detailed help available from 
          the &quot;Help&quot; menu selection at the top of the web page.</font></u></font></b></font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000099">The 
          Address Search </font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#333333">When 
          searching by address, omit all street prefixes (north, south, east, 
          west, or N, S, E, W) and all street suffixes (St., Ave., apt#, etc.) 
          It is not necessary to have both a house number and street name to generate 
          a candidate list; either of the two can begin the process. <br>
          House numbers do not need to be complete. For example, entering &quot;97&quot; 
          will return all house numbers that begin with &quot;97&#133;&quot;. 
          Street names do not have to be complete. A partial street name, or even 
          a single letter, is sufficient to generate a candidate list. <br>

        <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000099">The 
          APN Search</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#333333"><b>Assessor 
          parcel numbers in this application use the full 10 digit APN. You may 
          include or exclude the dashes commonly associated with APNs. For example, 
          an APN entered like this &quot;009-012-0750&quot; or this &quot;0090120750 
          will be found.<br>
          To search the database for a single APN, it is not necessary to enter 
          a complete number string in the &quot;from:&quot; dialog box. You can 
          entering a partial APN and allow the application to produce a candidate 
          list of all APNs that complete the sequence. For example, entering the 
          first part of our example APN like this &quot;009012&quot;, will cause 
          the application to produce a candidate list of APNs like &quot;0090120750&quot;,&quot;0090120760&quot;,&quot;0090120770&quot;,&quot;0090120850&quot; 
          and so on from which you can pick.</b></font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#333333">To 
          search for a range of APNs, enter a beginning APN in the &quot;from:&quot; 
          dialog box, and then an ending APN in the optional &quot;to:&quot; box. 
          If you encounter trouble finding a specific APN in the database, search 
          using a range of numbers. This will generate a candidate list from which 
          you can pick the specific APN.</font></b></p>

          Intersection Search</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#333333">The 
          intersection search automatically zooms the map view to the intersection 
          entered by the user. If there is more than one intersection matching 
          the search criteria, the user will be able to select an intersection 
          from a candidate list. Once the map has been zoomed to the selected 
          intersection the user can use the &quot;Identify&quot; tool on the bottom 
          toolbar to point at a specific property. The selected property will 
          be hi-lighted and the property information page will display the property 
          details. You can also use the identify tool to drag a rectangle across 
          multiple properties and instantly see details for all of them.</font></b></font></p>
