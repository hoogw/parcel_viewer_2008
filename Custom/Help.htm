        color=#333333>This website uses several different search methods for 
        locating information for you. You can find a property of interest by 
        looking up an address, an assessor parcel number, or by cross streets. 
        These searches are visible on the right side of the web page when it 
        first opens. Using any of these searches will immediately return 
        information about the subject property as well as zooming to a map view 
        of the property. If the search criteria is not specific enough the 
        applications will replace the search panel area of the web page with a 
        list of candidate properties that most closely meet your search 
        criteria. You can scroll through the list of candidates to find the 
        property you are interested in. Each candidate property has a 
        hyper-link. Selecting the link will display the detailed property 
        information, as well as zoom the map display to that location.<BR>In 
        most cases, a less specific search is better. This allows the website to 
        work for you, to return properties that meet your search criteria but 
        may have a slightly different spelling or are stored in the database a 
        little different. Each search method has an associated search tips link 
        next to the "Search" button. Use these search tips to improve your odds 
        of finding the correct property. These tips are also covered below in 
        this help page.</FONT></B></FONT><BR></P>

        <P><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#333333 size=3>The 
        website also provides easy to use tools for saving and printing the 
        information found. Users can also print the map page, either by itself 
        or in a preformatted layout including legends, map scale, title, and 
        locator map. Using the simple map navigation tools at the bottom of the 
        page you can also interactively zoom in/out from a specific map view as 
        well as drag the map to center on a specific location. Once a property 
        has been visually located, use the map "Identify" tool to click on any 
        property (map location) to see details about the selected property. You 
        can also use the "Layers" selection on the bottom toolbar to create a 
        custom map view by turning on/off specific map layers they are 
        interested in. Additionally users can use the buffering tool to find 
        information on surrounding properties and create mailing labels for 
        those properties.</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT size=2><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
        color=#333333 size=3>There are 3 sets of tools to choose from when 
        working with this website. As with many computer applications there is a 
        menu system at the top of the page for users who prefer that type of 
        interface. There is also a toolbar at the bottom of the page that 
        contains most of the functions available from the menu interface. There 
        is also a floating toolbar that also contains most of the most commonly 
        used tools. In most cases a user will easily navigate this site using 
        the toolbar on the bottom of the page, and the search and results 
        information presented in the information panel on the right side of the 
        page. Hovering your mouse over a tool icon will pop-up text that 
        identifies the tools use.</FONT><FONT 
        face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3> <U><FONT color=#990000>There

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3><B><FONT 
        color=#333333>When searching by address, omit all street prefixes 
        (north, south, east, west, or N, S, E, W) and all street suffixes (St., 
        Ave., apt#, etc.) It is not necessary to have both a house number and 
        street name to generate a candidate list; either of the two can begin 
        the process. <BR>House numbers do not need to be complete. For example, 
        entering "97" will return all house numbers that begin with "97…". 
        Street names do not have to be complete. A partial street name, or even 
        a single letter, is sufficient to generate a candidate list.

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#333333 
        size=3><B>Assessor parcel numbers in this application use the full 10 
        digit APN. You may include or exclude the dashes commonly associated 
        with APNs. For example, an APN entered like this "009-012-0750" or this 
        "0090120750 will be found.<BR>To search the database for a single APN, 
        it is not necessary to enter a complete number string in the "from:" 
        dialog box. You can entering a partial APN and allow the application to 
        produce a candidate list of all APNs that complete the sequence. For 
        example, entering the first part of our example APN like this "009012", 
        will cause the application to produce a candidate list of APNs like 
        "0090120750","0090120760","0090120770","0090120850" and so on from which 
        you can pick.</B></FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#333333 size=3>To 
        search for a range of APNs, enter a beginning APN in the "from:" dialog 
        box, and then an ending APN in the optional "to:" box. If you encounter 
        trouble finding a specific APN in the database, search using a range of 
        numbers. This will generate a candidate list from which you can pick the 
        specific APN.</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT size=2><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
        color=#333333 size=3>The intersection search automatically zooms the map 
        view to the intersection entered by the user. If there is more than one 
        intersection matching the search criteria, the user will be able to 
        select an intersection from a candidate list. Once the map has been 
        zoomed to the selected intersection the user can use the "Identify" tool 
        on the bottom toolbar to point at a specific property. The selected 
        property will be hi-lighted and the property information page will 
        display the property details. You can also use the identify tool to drag 
        a rectangle across multiple properties and instantly see details for all 
        of them.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
